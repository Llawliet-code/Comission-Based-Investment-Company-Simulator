# Comission-Based-Investment-Company-Simulator

  - This project, "Commission-Based Investment Model in C," implements a hierarchical investment system using a binary tree data structure to represent different levels of investors. Each node in the tree represents an investor, starting with a head investor at the root, and subsequent levels represent sub-investors.
